1. Do you have any previous programming experience? If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial thoughts about the C language and this course?


I have some programming experience; I’m familiar with Javascript (although I’ve heard some people say it’s not a programming language), and I also watched a few CS50 lectures last year and completed a few of their problem sets. I’m still very new to programming, but I’m excited to learn more about C, especially since I see it shares similarities with Javascript.


However, I was pretty nervous about using the required software in this course (e.g. PuTTy, WinSCP, Visual Studio etc.) because I’m a (very faithful) Mac user. But after learning that I can use Mac-friendly alternatives like VS Code and do everything else from the Terminal, my nerves subsided. I also started to look at my situation more positively: Although having a Mac may bring more challenges in this course, it will encourage me to take more initiative and research my alternatives on my own. Afterall, a good programmer is a good researcher.


2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.


Compiling is the process of converting C, a human-readable code, into a language computers can read: machine code, which is a series of 0s and 1s. For a computer to execute a program, it must compile the C file first. I compiled my C files using commands in the Terminal.


3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.


I hope learning C will make me more confident when it comes to programming. One of the reasons I stopped doing CS50 was because I got discouraged when it became more difficult. One of my goals is to complete it, so hopefully, this course will help me do so.


Additionally, I hope to be able to apply what I learn in this course to other languages, especially Javascript. I’ve been studying Javascript on and off for about six months, but I still don’t feel fully comfortable with it. But, one of my professors at Seneca said he was able to learn Javascript in just a week after learning C.  So, I’m hoping IPC144 will strengthen my Javascript knowledge and make learning other languages in the future easier.
